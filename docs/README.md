> **`internal/` is notes, not documentation.** Entries marked _historical_ or
> _aspirational_ describe what was planned or once existed; several name modules that were
> never built or have since been renamed. Nothing there should be read as a description of
> the current code — [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) and [FEATURES.md](FEATURES.md) are.
