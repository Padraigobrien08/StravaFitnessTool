StrideIQ is a **local-first** Next.js app that turns Strava exports (or live API sync) into a coherent training operating system — not another chart dashboard. Deterministic engines compute metrics; the Coach and LLM layers **orchestrate tools** and must not invent numbers.

> **Repository:** `StravaFitnessTool` on GitHub · **Product name:** StrideIQ  
> **Status:** MVP (`v0.1.0-mvp`) — private beta

## ⚡ Try the demo (zero setup)

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** and click **“Try the demo.”**

That loads a full **12-month sample athlete** (mid-build for a sub-1:45 half marathon) so you can explore _every_ client-side surface instantly — **no Strava account, no database, no API key**. Hit **Exit demo** in the header to clear it. Prefer your own data? Use **Import** (100% in-browser) — see [Quick start](#quick-start).

![StrideIQ Home — console briefing with today's focus, readiness and TSB, projected half-marathon finish, and the recent-change feed](docs/screenshots/home.png)

<sub>All screenshots are the built-in demo athlete — every number shown is computed from the sample data by the same deterministic engines that run on your own.</sub>

## Why StrideIQ

| Typical Strava tooling | StrideIQ                                                           |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Charts and totals      | Question-led surfaces (“Am I ready?” “What changed?”)              |
| Static dashboards      | **Athlete Intelligence Model** — curated belief state              |
| Generic AI chat        | **Coach** with deterministic tool-use over your data               |
| Disconnected planning  | **Adaptive week plan** with context, save, and execution vs actual |

**Design principle:** every screen answers one user question. Insights ship with evidence, confidence, and recommendations — not orphaned graphs.

---

## Features

### Data ingestion

- **Strava bulk export** — `activities.csv` + optional FIT `activities/` folder (two-step import)
- **Strava OAuth** — live sync to Postgres (local Docker or hosted Neon)
- **Webhooks** — optional background activity sync
- **Privacy-first export path** — no account or server required for core analytics

### Training intelligence

| Surface                    | What you get                                                                            |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Home**                   | Operating-system layout: focus, week board, change feed, decision support               |
| **Plan**                   | Planning context, AI/rule-based week generation, drag-and-drop board, planned vs actual |
| **Goals**                  | Race briefing, readiness, forecasts, mission control                                    |
| **Training & Performance** | Volume, blocks, efficiency, projections, records                                        |
| **Runs**                   | Activity explorer, session intelligence, route replay (MapLibre)                        |
| **Intelligence**           | Persistent athlete belief model — signals, memory, ecosystem (not a chat UI)            |
| **Coach**                  | Investigation workspace — threaded reasoning with server-backed tools                   |
| **Report**                 | Printable training change summary                                                       |

#### Intelligence — the curated belief model

A read-first surface, not a chat window: what the system currently believes, how each signal is
moving, and what to do about it. Every claim carries its evidence and confidence.

![StrideIQ Intelligence — current focus and belief, how each signal is moving, and decision support split into risks, opportunities, and a primary action](docs/screenshots/intelligence.png)

#### Goals — forecasts that admit what they don't know

The forecast reports a range and a confidence, then names its own weakest assumption. Here the
engine holds the band open because its models have never been scored against a race this athlete
actually ran: _"The models agree with each other, which is not the same as being right."_

![StrideIQ Goals — half-marathon forecast of 1h 37m with a p25–p75 range, evidence list, explicit confidence reasoning, and a limitations panel](docs/screenshots/goals.png)

#### Coach — threaded investigation over deterministic tools

The Coach orchestrates; it does not compute. Numbers come from the same
[44 deterministic tools](#reasoning-tools-deterministic) the HTTP API exposes. Chat needs an LLM
key, so the demo shows the reasoning workspace with the chat path disabled — the banner is the
app telling you exactly what is and isn't live.

| **Connected**   | Postgres (local/Neon) + session cookie   | Full Coach, webhooks, MCP |

---

## Quick start

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js** 20+
- **npm** 10+
- **Docker** — optional, only for the local Postgres in Path B (skip if you use hosted Neon)

### Run locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Padraigobrien08/StravaFitnessTool.git
cd StravaFitnessTool
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional — see paths below
npm run dev
```

Open **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)**.

### Choose your path

| Path                | Setup time | `.env.local`                         | Capabilities                                                     |
| ------------------- | ---------- | ------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A — Export only** | ~5 min     | Empty or omit                        | Home, Training, Goals, Plan, Runs, Report, Intelligence (client) |
| **B — Full stack**  | ~20 min    | Strava + Postgres (local/Neon) + LLM | OAuth sync, Coach, webhooks, MCP                                 |

Capability matrix: [docs/RELEASE_MVP.md](docs/RELEASE_MVP.md).

<details>
<summary><strong>Path A — Export only (no API keys)</strong></summary>

1. Strava → **Settings → My Account** → download your data → unzip.
2. **Import** → upload export folder (`activities.csv` required).
3. Optional: upload the `activities/` folder for FIT stream detail.
4. **Home** — confirm runs load.
5. **Goals** — set race distance and date.
6. **Plan** — add optional context → **Generate** → **Save week**.
7. **Settings** — theme toggle; **Clear data** uses a confirmation dialog.

No Strava API app or database required.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Path B — OAuth + Coach</strong></summary>

1. **Scaffold `.env.local`** — generates a `SESSION_SECRET` and presets the local database URL:

   ```bash
   npm run setup
   ```

2. **Set up the database.** Pick one:

   - **Local Postgres (Docker)** — no cloud account:

     ```bash
     docker compose up -d    # Postgres on localhost:5432
     npm run db:migrate      # apply db/migrations/*
     ```

   - **Hosted (Neon or any Postgres):** put its connection string in `DATABASE_URL`, then `npm run db:migrate`.

   The driver is auto-selected from the connection string. `npm run db:reset` rebuilds the schema from scratch.

3. Create a [Strava API application](https://www.strava.com/settings/api). For local dev, set **Authorization Callback Domain** to `localhost`.

4. Fill in the rest of [`.env.local`](.env.example) (`npm run setup` already set `SESSION_SECRET` and `DATABASE_URL`):

   ```bash
   # DATABASE_URL preset to local Docker; replace for Neon:
   #   DATABASE_URL=postgresql://strideiq:strideiq@localhost:5432/strideiq
   STRAVA_CLIENT_ID=...
   STRAVA_CLIENT_SECRET=...
   STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI=          # leave blank — callback follows the host you browse
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...   # or ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
   ```

5. Restart the dev server → **Import → Connect Strava** → sync activities.
6. **Goals** → race goal → **Plan** → generate and save → **Coach** → ask a training question.

</details>

### View on your phone or tablet

StrideIQ runs on your machine but is reachable from other devices.

```bash
npm run dev:lan   # serves on your LAN (0.0.0.0)
npm run lan       # prints the URL to open on your phone + Strava setup hint
```

- **Demo & Strava-export import** work over the LAN URL (`http://<your-ip>:3000`) with no extra setup.
- **Live Strava OAuth** needs the host registered as your Strava app's **Authorization Callback Domain** (the callback follows whatever host you browse, as long as `STRAVA_REDIRECT_URI` is blank):
  - **Same Wi-Fi:** set the callback domain to your machine's LAN IP (shown by `npm run lan`), then open `http://<ip>:3000` on the device.
  - **Anywhere / clean HTTPS:** run a tunnel and register its hostname instead —

    ```bash
    cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000   # or: ngrok http 3000
    ```

    Set the callback domain to the printed `*.trycloudflare.com` (or ngrok) host and open that URL on any device.

### Verify

```bash
npm test && npm run build
# or
./scripts/verify.sh
```

Manual QA: [docs/SMOKE_TEST.md](docs/SMOKE_TEST.md).

## Development

### Project structure

```
app/                      # Next.js App Router (pages + API)
components/               # Feature UI (coach, plan, home, goals, …)
components/ui/            # shadcn/ui primitives
lib/
  strava/ domain/         # Ingest + normalized activities
  analytics/ insights/  # Metrics + narratives
  intelligence/         # Server bundle, tools, chat
  reasoning/            # Deterministic reasoning primitives
  training-calendar/    # Plan persistence & validation
hooks/                    # Data hooks for pages

packages/strideiq-mcp/    # MCP server
docs/                     # Architecture, deploy, smoke tests
```

**Rule:** UI consumes domain models and view models — never raw Strava CSV rows.

### Scripts

| Command               | Description                                                |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run dev`         | Development server                                         |
| `npm run dev:lan`     | Dev server on your LAN (reachable from other devices)      |
| `npm run lan`         | Print the LAN URL + Strava callback hint for device access |
| `npm run build`       | Production build                                           |
| `npm run start`       | Start production server                                    |
| `npm test`            | Vitest test suite                                          |
| `npm run check`       | Typecheck + lint + tests (CI gate)                         |
| `./scripts/verify.sh` | Test + build gate                                          |

### FIT import note

Strava CSV often references `activities/<id>.fit.gz` without bundling files. Upload the export folder first, then the `activities/` directory from your full archive. FIT streams are stored in IndexedDB and power route replay and stream intelligence.

### Webhooks

| Endpoint                                  | Purpose                        |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| `GET/POST /api/webhooks/strava`           | Verification + activity events |
| `GET/POST /api/webhooks/strava/subscribe` | Subscription management        |

Enable from **Settings** after OAuth is connected. Refresh the app after webhook events (no live push to the client yet). Note that this path is unit-tested but has never been exercised against a live Strava subscription — see [docs/DEPLOYMENT.md § Webhooks](docs/DEPLOYMENT.md#webhooks-optional-auto-sync).

## Known MVP limitations

- Unit preference is saved in Settings; chart labels remain km-centric until a future release.
- Saved training weeks live in browser `localStorage` (not synced per user to Neon).
- Coach and full intelligence bundle require server env and LLM keys.
- See [docs/RELEASE_MVP.md](docs/RELEASE_MVP.md) for the full list.

## Troubleshooting

**Dev server uses huge amounts of memory / the machine swaps or crashes.**
Next.js/Turbopack picks the workspace root by walking _up_ for a lockfile. If a stray `package.json`/`package-lock.json` sits in a parent directory (e.g. your home folder), it can root there and watch your _entire_ home directory, exhausting memory. This repo pins the root via `turbopack.root` in [`next.config.ts`](next.config.ts); if you still hit it, remove the stray lockfile from the parent directory.
