 * Two projects, because the two kinds of test have genuinely different needs.
 *
 * The node project is everything that existed before: server code, analytics, parsing.
 * It must keep running without a DOM — several of those modules guard on
 * `typeof window === "undefined"`, and giving them a jsdom global would quietly stop
 * testing the server path they exist to cover.
 *
 * The ui project adds jsdom and Testing Library for component tests only. Scoping it
 * this way also keeps the ~1250 existing tests at their current speed, since jsdom
 * setup costs roughly a second per file.
