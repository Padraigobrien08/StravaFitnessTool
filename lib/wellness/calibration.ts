/**
 * Per-athlete calibration of the leg-feel nudge (P3).
 *
 * v1 heuristic — deliberately conservative:
 *  - Below a history threshold, everyone gets the proven default (−12 / +5).
 *  - Once there's enough history, an athlete whose reports reliably track the
 *    objective load model (when it has a clear view) earns MORE trust — the
 *    nudge is amplified within a hard cap.
 *  - It is **amplify-only**: it never dampens below the default, so a reporter
 *    who diverges from the model (the case the feature exists for) keeps full
 *    weight. Safety-first.
 *
 * "Agreement with the load model" is a proxy for thoughtful reporting, not a
 * requirement — a future version can replace this with true feel↔outcome
 * calibration once enough outcome data has accrued.
