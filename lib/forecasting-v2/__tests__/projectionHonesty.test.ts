/**
 * Two defects found by backtesting the one race on file that can be scored —
 * a half the athlete ran in 1:44:17, held out and re-predicted from the data
 * available the day before. See scripts/backtest-race-forecast.mts.
 *
 *  1. With no race goal set, `buildRaceForecastInput` returned null, so the
 *     Performance page silently fell back to the legacy consensus projection.
 *     That model predicted 2:14:58 (+29.4%); this engine predicted 1:52:05
 *     (+7.5%) on the same data.
 *  2. The interval width came only from how much the capability models disagree
 *     with each other. They agreed, so the band was ±1% around a point estimate
 *     that was 7.5% out.
