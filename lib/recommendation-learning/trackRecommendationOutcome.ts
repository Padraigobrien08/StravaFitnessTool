 * outcomes in the same call, so every recommendation was being graded in the instant
 * it was issued, against the very analytics that produced it. A verdict of
 * "supported" then meant "this advice matched the current state", not "this advice
 * worked" — and `updateBeliefsFromOutcome` minted a belief captioned "Historical
 * evidence suggests…" on that basis. Unearned beliefs are worse than no beliefs.
 *
 * A training recommendation needs at least a day before any signal could exist:
 * freshness, readiness and efficiency all move on daily-or-slower timescales.
 * Anything younger stays pending rather than being resolved on no evidence.
