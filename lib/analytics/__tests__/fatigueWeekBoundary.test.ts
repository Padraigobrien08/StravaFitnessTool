/**
 * Acute load must not depend on which day of the week you look.
 *
 * Load is bucketed into calendar weeks and averaged as though every bucket were a
 * whole week. The current week is not: on a Monday it held a single day, so acute
 * load collapsed and the athlete read as fresh. Measured on the demo athlete, ATL
 * fell 66 → 40 and freshness rose 49 → 86 between Sunday and Monday on identical
 * training — then recovered through the week.
 *
 * It was not cosmetic. `fatigueState` decides whether the fallback planner prescribes
 * a recovery week, and freshness ≥ 70 trips the Coach's "freshness supports quality
 * work" line. Every Monday, an athlete who had trained hard was told to go hard.
 *
 * CI found it a day early: the time-travel job runs the suite a year ahead, which
 * landed on a Monday before the calendar did.

/**
 * An athlete who runs the same load every day from a *fixed* start date to `endingAt`.
 *
 * Anchored to a fixed Monday on purpose. A rolling "last N days" fixture varies how
 * complete its oldest calendar week is depending on the day you probe, which drags CTL
 * and shows up as a week-boundary effect that has nothing to do with the current week.
 * That confounded the first version of these tests.
 *
 * Long enough (~40 weeks) that CTL has converged. At ten weeks it is still warming up
 * against its six-week time constant, so it climbs every week — real behaviour, but it
 * drifts across the discontinuity in `freshnessFromTsb` at tsb = -10, where an 0.1
 * change in balance moves freshness by eleven points. That is a separate wart; this
 * file is about the week boundary, so the fixture removes the warm-up rather than
 * asserting around it.
